    <p>
    Hello! I'm Szymon Dziwak, a passionate and creative software developer.
    At my current workplace I program in Java. I have two years of professional experience with Java, but have been learning to program as a hobby for 10 years.
    I am interested in creating high performance software. I am especially interested in Rust and Go, but I am not afraid of C and C++.
    This page is mainly about my Rust and Go projects because it is my long-term goal to find Rust or Go related job.
    If you want to see all my skills and projects ask me for CV or see my GitHub page.
